# iOSDiceGame

I'm attempting to re-write a JavaScript Dice game that I wrote whilst in bootcamp, into an iOS application. 

Not having been professionally taught iOS at all, what I attempt is through old textbooks, YouTube and various stabs in the dark  :-)   

It's quite fun though.....  

This is an on-going project, updates to follow when available.....  or when they actually work !!   :-)
